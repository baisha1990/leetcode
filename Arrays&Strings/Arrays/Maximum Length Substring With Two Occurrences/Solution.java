/*
Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substring such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "bcbbbcba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
 
Constraints:
2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
